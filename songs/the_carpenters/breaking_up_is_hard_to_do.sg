  \begin{verse*}
    Remember when you hold me tight
    And then you kissed me all through the night
    Think of all that we've been through
    'Cause breaking up is hard to do
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse}
    I beg of you don't say good-bye
    Can't we give our love another try
    And maybe it'll start anew
    'Cause breaking up is hard to do
  \end{verse}
