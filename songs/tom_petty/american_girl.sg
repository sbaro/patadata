  \begin{verse}
    \[D] Well she was an A\[E7]merican girl
    \[G] Raised on \[A]promises
    \[D] She couldn't help \[E7]thinking that there was
    A \[G]little more to life \[A]somewhere else
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    After all it was a \[D]great big world
    \[G] With lots of places to \[Em]run to
    \[A]And if she had to die tryin' she had one little promise she was gonna keep
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[G] Oh yeah, \[A] allright
    \[D] Take it easy baby
    \[Bm] Make it last all night
    \[G] She was \[A] an American \[D]girl
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{repeatedchords}
    \begin{verse}
      \[D] Well it was kinda \[E7]cold that night
      \[G]She stood alone on the \[A]balcony
      \[D] Yeah, she could hear the \[E7]cars roll by
      Out on \[G]four forty one like \[A]waves crashing on the beach
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse*}
      And for one desperate \[D]moment there
      \[G]He crept back in her \[Em]memory
      \[A]God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far to reach
    \end{verse*}
  \end{repeatedchords}
